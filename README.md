# Dexter AI

A small static demo served from `index.html`.

How to view locally:

```bash
# open in default browser
open index.html
# or serve on a local HTTP server
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Purpose: quick static prototype. Add more documentation here as the project grows.
